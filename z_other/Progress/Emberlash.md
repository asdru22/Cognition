- not necessarily a sword, could be a sickle type weapon
- uses electroplasm to charge
- slowly depletes electroplasm when used
- instead of breaking it needs to be charged with electroplasm again
- custom enchants for when they get added:
  - rebirth: area damage when recharging
  - last hurrah: when below 10% charge, deals more damage

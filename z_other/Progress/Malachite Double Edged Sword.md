[[Malachite Shield]]

- very fragile
- shatters if it hits a block or the player punches it
- reforms into the player's hands
- expensive crafting recipe
- crafted with screws, malachite blades and breeze rod

Can be thrown and returns to player. When punched will shatter into 10 fragments. Using the bladeless handle will cause the malachite shards to return to the player. The fragments will be destroyed when they hit a block.
The sword will repair if the player obtains 10 shards. Otherwise the handle can be repaired in a Heavy workbench with 2 malachite knives

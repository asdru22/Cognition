# [!] READ CAREFULLY [!]
### THIS IS A DATAPACK, NOT A MOD. THIS MEANS THAT IT'S NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SOME MODS AND DOESN'T WORK ON SERVERS THAT USE PLUGINS LIKE PAPERMC. I CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. THE RESOURCEPACK IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO USE THE DATAPACK. THE RESOURCEPACK USES SHADERS THAT CAN POTENTIALLY BREAK WITH MODS THAT CHANGE SHADERS LIKE IRIS.

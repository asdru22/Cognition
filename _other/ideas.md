    - expensive crafting recipe

- ender urn
    - stack-like interaction
    - can be easily placed/removed
- honey bubbles
    - when a honey block is above greek fire, it will produce a honey bubble
    - honey bubbles will travel upwards and if an entity is sitting on top of the honey bubble when it forms it will transport them upwards
    - honey bubbles pop after 4 seconds or when hitting dripstone
    - bubbles will be produced every 10 seconds approx but if you cover the honey block, the bubble will be delayed until the block is removed
